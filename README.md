Propagate is a multi-level puzzle game build with react-native.

TODO:
- animation on title screen title + button
- transition from title screen into game
- game roadmap and levels instead of rogue-like?
- better scoring system
- better icons for mode selector
- Settings to turn on different modes (tri-color, easy/medium/hard)
- Leaderboard (save this data somewhere)
